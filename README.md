# National Voter File

We provide an easy-to-use, modern-era database with voter files for each of the fifty states. It uses a data model that represents a national voter file as well as associated campaign measures in a shared data warehouse.

We want to pull politics into the 21st century, and we're starting from the ground up.

### Goals

* Reliable, up-to-date voter data for every state in the country (including address changes, and redrawn districts)
* All available via an easy-to-consume REST API
* For thousands to use our voter file to power their campaigns' donation, canvassing, and phonebanking efforts!

## How does it work?

Glad you asked! Simple, we:

### 1. Collect voter files from every state

We've done nine states so far. We'd [love your help collecting them all](https://trello.com/b/IlZkwYc0/national-voter-file-states-pipeline).

### 2. Extract and transform that data

Each state does it differently, some (way) worse than others. Using well-tested, state-specific [transformer scripts](src/python/national_voter_file/transformers/README.md) written in Python, we turn them into consistent CSV files.

### 3. Load that data into a Postgres database

We load the data using [Pentaho](tools/README.md), and contain the database and its query layer [within Docker](docker/README.md) so that it is platform agnostic.

### 4. Build [a simple, accessible, easy-to-vend API](https://github.com/national-voter-file/national-voter-file-api) for consumers.

We haven't started on this yet. It's coming soon!
